# Awesome Cloud Native

> Cloud native infrastructure is infrastructure that is hidden behind useful abstractions, controlled by APIs, managed by software, and has the purpose of running applications. Running infrastructure with these traits gives rise to a new pattern for managing that infrastructure in a scalable, efficient way.
 

A cloud native application is engineered to run on a platform and is designed for: 

* **Resiliency**  - Embraces failures instead of trying to prevent them; it takes advantage of the dynamic nature of running on a platform. Resilience (roughly synonymous with fault tolerance) is a measure of how well a system withstands and recovers from errors and faults. A system can be considered resilient if it can continue operating correctly—possibly at a reduced level—rather than failing completely when some part of the system fails. Capital One Definition 
* **Agility** allows for fast deployments and quick iterations.  
* **Operability** adds control of application life cycles from inside the application instead of relying on external processes and monitors.  
* **Observability** provides information to answer questions about application state.
